# Goal 
As part of the AI4Good Lab 3-week project creation, we decided to build a tool to diagnose motor speech disorders (dysarthrias) caused by conditions such as Parkinsonâ€™s and ALS from user audio input. Refer to `notebook.ipynb` for an in-depth review of the project.

# File explorer
` ` ` feature_extraction.ipynb ` ` ` 

Contains the code for extracting sound features relevant to dysarthria diagnosis from audio files.

 ` ` ` smote.py ` ` `

Contains two functions, `smote_binary` and `smote_multiclass`, that oversample or undersample a dataframe using the SMOTE technique and one-hot encode it.

` ` ` performance_report.py ` ` `

Contains an eponymous function that generates a CSV file with various performance metrics and graphs for easy comparison of models.

` ` ` logistic_regression.py ` ` `

Contains a function that fits a logistic regression model for each of the specified n classes (default is 1) and returns the necessary parameters for `performance_report`.
